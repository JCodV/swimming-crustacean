how to implement gravity and jumping?

translation = position
we need a vector for velocity whose direction changes based on
whether we are jumping or not

if space is pressed && on ground:
	velocity = 1 * jump_speed
	jumping = true

if not on ground and not jumping:
	apply gravity
	velocity += gravity
